    <h2>Lionel Alvarado</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Lionel Alvarado and I'm from Peru. I'm majoring in Software Development.</p>
    <p>My parents were baptized into the church when they were young, so I was blessed to be born into a Latter-day Saint home. I have a lot of favorite scriptures but I would like share only one:"But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance". (1 Nephi 1:20)</p>
    <p>My first degree was Mechanical Engineering, but I've always been attracted to technology, so I want to learn software development to apply it within my professional field.</p>
    <p>My favorite hobbie is play the guitar, I love music.</p>
